// My Tic Tac Toe App

// Should be a source of truth for the tic tac toe game
// basically an array of arrays 
// each time there is a change, the app should update the model and rerender everything

// information should be drawn with divs that hold nothing or an x

// first step, create an html page with a blank tic tac toe board 
// get that to render

console.log('hi');
